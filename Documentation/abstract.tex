\paragraph{}
The aim of this work is to research suitable visualization techniques for application in data flow graph based analysis systems. To accomplish this, a literature survey was performed over the relevant works in the fields of both visualization and data analysis platforms. An examination of appropriate matches between analysis tasks and visualization techniques was performed, from which a prototypical visualization system for use in analysis scenarios was developed.

\paragraph{}
Several application scenarios are examined using the developed visualization system, and a discussion of the value of visualization in each scenario is given. Finally, implementation details of the visualization framework and potential areas for future improvement are given.
